# MachineLearningAlgorithm
Machine learning  is a class of methods for automatically creating models from data. Machine learning algorithms are the engines of machine learning, meaning it is the algorithms that turn a data set into a model.Here, we have a dataset "task_1.csv", where the first column is the number of hours of study and second column is the marks obtained by studying the corresponding number of hours. Student Percentage.ipynb is a python file where we are predicting the percentage  of an student based on number of study hours using simple regression technique.
